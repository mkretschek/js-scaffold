scaffold
========

A collection of support modules containing utilities commonly needed in JS
projects. Much like [underscore][], but designed to be used by other AMD
modules, allowing to require just the tools your project need.


Tests
-----

Scaffold uses [karma][] to run its tests, therefore you'll need to
have [npm][] and scaffold's development dependencies installed before you
can run them.

To install scaffold's dependencies, just run:

```
npm install
```

Then run its tests with:

```
npm test
```
